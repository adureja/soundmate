## Soundmate

This is a personal project created during the summer of 2016. This Chrome extension uses the SoundCloud API and extension messaging to act as a fully functioning radio application. Soundmate lets you discover new music while continuing browsing the Internet! 

NOTE: A SoundCloud API key is required for this extension to function; this can be requested on the SoundCloud website.
